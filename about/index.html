      Hi, I'm Lee! If your reading this you probably are interested in what I'm
      working on. Right now, it's mostly functional programming. I've always
      been a little intrigued, but spent most of my time just building things
      with Python/Go/React. Lately I've been working on an OMS+Risk system in
      OCaml. I work professionally in finance at the moment, so I understand the
      domain enough to be able to focus on the tech side for now.
      <br /><br />
      The big benefit of working on a project like this is to understand how to
      map business/domain logic into an expressive type system; so far compared
      to OOP I quite like it. Feels like the constraints can be determined much
      better at compile time, and refactoring / adding new features feels much
      simpler. Long term, I could see myself switching over to Rust since it's
      also in the ML family. Maybe more synth projects and audio processing
      projects are in my future.
      <br /><br />
      In terms of tech skills, I'd like to think I know quite a bit. I've used
      Go, Python, React, Typescript+Javascript, C++, SQL, now Elixir and Ocaml,
      and a whole lot of Bash. Pretty comfortable with K8s/Docker/Ansible as
      well. Honestly as long as I've got a challenging problem and time to focus
      I'll be happy
      <br /><br />
      Other assorted interests include: my cats (Meeko, Kiko, and Alma ❤️),
      vinyls, youtube House mixes, perusing Hacker News, nature, cooking, and
      convincing people Cleveland isn't too bad.
